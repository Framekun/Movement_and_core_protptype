So, I decided to write this to tell what does what.

- The BigBad is Giant type of enemy, should have dodgeable attack, slow and have holes, but very punishing if hit. 
Also have alot of health and is slow (inital speed boost recommended)

- The Bomber is Suicidal Bomber, They die when they attacked. 
The attack should have delay and deal big damage when it was not intercepted. 

- The Charger is Slow... until they decided to attack. They attack in straight line. trying to hit the player.

- The Shealth is trasparent and does not have their HP shown. Recommend for ambush attack

- The Windup has high damage, but the attack requires a little bit of winding up
If regular enemy have winding up, this will be slower or very noticeable.
